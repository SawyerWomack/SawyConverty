This tool has one philosephy: Ease of use
I created this tool to avoid those horrible websites that make you download malware whenever you want to convert from mp4 to mov and also to avoid the complex tools that give far too much information when all i  want to do is convert from mp4 to mov. 
This tool solves both of these problems by creating a simple and intewitive way to download youtube videos and convert between different media file types

# Installation
While I work on creating a installer, this is how you download and run the program
First make sure you have all of the python packages that are listed below

Probably already installed:
- subprocess
- os
- threading

Use pip to install:
- Tkinter
- SupportedFileTypes
- ffmpeg_progress
- pytube
- pathlib

After this, download the src file and extract it. After that simply run main.py and youre good to go!
